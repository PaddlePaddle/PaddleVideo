In the forward pass, it takes input images and calculates logits and output from the LSTM network. The loss is then computed based on these logits and labels, and metrics such as hit_at_one, perr, and gap are calculated using the output and labels. The validation and testing steps perform similar calculations to those in the training step. In the inference step, only image and audio data are processed to produce output for each input.",
