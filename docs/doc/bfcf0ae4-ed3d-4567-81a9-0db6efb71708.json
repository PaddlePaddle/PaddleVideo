It uses the json module for reading and writing JSON data. The original file is labeled 'label_cls14_train.json' and has gts from index 0 to 4 in the validation set, and gts from index 5 onwards in the training set. The code also writes a new validation set in '/home/aistudio/data/label_cls14_val.json' with the same fps (25).",
