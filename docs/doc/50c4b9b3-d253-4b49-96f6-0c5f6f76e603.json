It initializes with data size, batch size, log interval, and optional keyword arguments. The update method must be implemented by subclasses to update the metric values. The class also has abstract methods that must be overridden in subclasses for actual functionality. It utilizes numpy, paddle, and PaddleVideo's utils for data manipulation and distribution information.",
