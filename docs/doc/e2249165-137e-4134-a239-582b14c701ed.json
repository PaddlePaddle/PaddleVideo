The frame rate of the video is uniformly standardized to 30 frames per second, and the image size is 1080 * 720 to ensure the relative consistency of the dataset. After that, we use the 2D pose estimation algorithm Open Pose to extract frame by frame key points from the video, and finally save the data in `.npy` format.\nThe directory structure of training dataset and test dataset is as follows:\n```txt\ntrain_data.npy        # 2922\ntrain_label.npy       # 2922\ntest_A_data.npy       # 628\ntest_B_data.npy       # 634\n```\n`train_label.npy` can be read using `np."
