It also defines a model for inferring image results from multiple views using forward_net function and averaging based on 'avg_type'.",

            "comment": "This code defines a RecognizerTransformer class that inherits from BaseRecognizer and implements a transformer-based recognizer model framework. It takes in an input tensor imgs of shape [N,C,T,H,W] where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, T is the temporal length, H is the height, and W is the width. If a backbone is specified, it applies the backbone to the images for feature extraction; otherwise, it uses the input images directly. The resulting feature tensor is returned.",
