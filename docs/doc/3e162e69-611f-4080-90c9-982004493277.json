            "comment": "NetVLAD is a class for implementing the NetVLAD algorithm. It takes parameters such as cluster_size, feature_size, ghost_clusters, and add_batch_norm. The feature_size represents the size of each feature, while the cluster_size represents the number of clusters. Ghost_clusters determines whether to include extra clusters for better performance. Add_batch_norm is a boolean value that decides whether or not to use batch normalization in the network.",
