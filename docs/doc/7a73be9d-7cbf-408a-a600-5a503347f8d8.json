It defines several Registry classes, each representing a different component of the video processing pipeline: BACKBONES, HEADS, RECOGNIZERS, LOCALIZERS, PARTITIONERS, SEGMENT, LOSSES, ROI_EXTRACTORS, DETECTORS, BBOX_ASSIGNERS, and BBOX_SAMPLERS. These Registry classes will be used to register and manage different instances of these components in the video processing pipeline.",
